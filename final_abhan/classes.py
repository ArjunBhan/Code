"""This program contains the classes for a memory game.  The userâ€™s goal in this game is to click on two cards
and match their numbers.  After clicking on the introduction screen, the user is tasked to select a difficulty
level which determines the number of pairs that need to be matched.  Matching a pair awards 100 points; whereas,
making an incorrect match takes away 25 points.  The game ends once all cards are successfully flipped.  Once the
game ends, the user has the option to either quit the program or play again.
