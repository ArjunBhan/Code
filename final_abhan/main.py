"""This program is a memory game.  The userâ€™s goal is to click on two cards and match their numbers.
After clicking on the introduction screen, the user is tasked to select a difficulty level which determines
the number of pairs that need to be matched.  Matching a pair awards 100 points; whereas, making an incorrect
match takes away 25 points.  The game ends once all cards are successfully flipped.  Once the game ends, the
user has the option to either quit the program or play again.
