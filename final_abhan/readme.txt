Memory Game readme.txt file.

In order to launch our memory game, simply run the file "main.py".  It is that simple! :)
Once the program begins, click anywhere on the screen to reach the difficulty selection menu.
Select a difficulty level out of the following options by clicking the respective button:
	Easy(4 pairs of cards totalling to 8 cards) 
	Medium (8 pairs of cards totalling to 16 cards)
	Hard (12 pairs of cards totalling to 24 cards) 
Once the game begins and cards appear, click on any covered card, causing it to temporarily flip over.
After clicking the first card, click on any other covered card, causing it to temporarly flip over.
If the cards match, both remain face up.
If the cards do NOT match, both cards flip back over.
Repeat this pattern until all of the pairs are revealed.
At the end of the game, the final score is displayed and the option to either continue playing or exit is given.

Have fun!
